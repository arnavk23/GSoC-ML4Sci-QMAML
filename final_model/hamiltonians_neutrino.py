Track E: collective neutrino oscillations -- reformulated as a ground-state problem.

**Why this needs a reformulation, stated up front.** The literature this track is nominally based on
(e.g. arXiv:2102.12556, quantum-simulating collective neutrino oscillations) studies *real-time evolution*:
prepare a flavor eigenstate, time-evolve it under the collective Hamiltonian, and track entanglement/flavor
observables as a function of time. That is not a ground-state/VQE problem and does not fit the Q-MAML
formalism (a Learner predicting a good VQE initial state) without a genuine change of question. This module
makes that change explicitly rather than silently: instead of asking "how does a flavor eigenstate evolve
under H(t)", it asks "what is the ground state of the same class of collective-oscillation Hamiltonian, and
can a Learner initialize a VQE to find it faster". This is not the cited paper's question, and this module
does not claim to reproduce any of its results. It is, however, a well-posed and physically motivated
question in its own right: the ground state of the collective (all-to-all) neutrino Hamiltonian is exactly
the object studied in the *adiabatic*/spectral-split literature on collective flavor transformation (Duan,
Fuller & Qian, Ann. Rev. Nucl. Part. Sci. 2010, and follow-on work treating the "co-rotating"/adiabatic
ground state as the physically relevant collective-oscillation endpoint), so a VQE ground-state search on
this Hamiltonian is a legitimate physics question, just a different one from real-time entanglement growth.
Flagged in the project's own tracks document as "a genuine research step, not just engineering" -- this is
that step, made explicit rather than glossed over.

**The Hamiltonian.** Standard two-flavor "bipolar"/single-angle collective neutrino Hamiltonian, N
neutrinos each represented by one flavor-isospin qubit (|0> = nu_e, |1> = nu_x), with a single-particle
vacuum-oscillation term set by the mixing angle theta and an all-to-all (collective) neutrino-neutrino
forward-scattering term set by interaction strength mu:

  H(theta, mu) = (omega/2) * sum_i ( cos(2*theta) Z_i + sin(2*theta) X_i )
               + (mu/N) * sum_{i<j} ( X_i X_j + Y_i Y_j + Z_i Z_j )

omega (vacuum oscillation frequency scale) is fixed to 1 (not a task parameter, matching how
hamiltonians_scalar.py fixes its representation parameter mu_disc); (theta, mu) are the task parameters --
theta is the standard neutrino mixing angle, mu/omega sets whether the system is in the weak-interaction
("bipolar oscillation") or strong-interaction ("synchronized") regime, a genuine physical crossover in the
collective-oscillation literature, analogous in spirit (though not mechanism) to Track C's phase transition.

MVP scale: N=4 neutrinos (4 qubits), matching this track's own "small, near-term" framing in the project's
tracks document.
