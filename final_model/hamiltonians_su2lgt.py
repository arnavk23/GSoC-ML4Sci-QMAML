Track D: SU(2) lattice gauge theory with dynamical matter, following the gauge-field-integrated-out
effective Hamiltonian of Atas, Zohar et al., "SU(2) hadrons on a quantum computer via a variational
approach" (Nature Communications 2021, arXiv:2102.08920), their Eqs. 3-6. This is the most directly
"LHC-relevant" HEP physics of any track in this project: the source paper computes actual meson/baryon
mass ratios from a non-Abelian lattice gauge theory.

N staggered lattice sites, 2 qubits per site (the two SU(2) color occupations, "red" and "green", at that
site), 2N qubits total, gauge field already eliminated analytically (exactly as in Track A's Schwinger
model, but for a genuinely non-Abelian SU(2) group here instead of U(1)):

  H = m_tilde * H_mass  +  (1/x) * H_electric  +  H_kinetic

  H_mass     = sum_{n=1}^{N} [ (-1)^n/2 * (Z_{2n-1} + Z_{2n}) + 1 ]
  H_kinetic  = -(1/2) * sum_{n=1}^{N-1} ( sigma+_{2n-1} Z_{2n} sigma-_{2n+1} + h.c. )
  H_electric = (3/16) * sum_{n=1}^{N-1} (N-n) * (1 - Z_{2n-1} Z_{2n})
             + (1/16) * sum_{n=1}^{N-2} sum_{m=n+1}^{N-1} (N-m) * (Z_{2n-1}-Z_{2n})(Z_{2m-1}-Z_{2m})
             + (1/2)  * sum_{n=1}^{N-2} sum_{m=n+1}^{N-1} (N-m) * ( sigma+_{2n-1} sigma-_{2n} sigma+_{2m} sigma-_{2m-1} + h.c. )

(1-indexed as in the paper; converted to 0-indexed qubits in code below.) m_tilde = a_l*m (dimensionless
fermion mass) and x = 1/(a_l^2 g^2) are the task parameters -- exactly the paper's own two continuous
physical knobs.

Transcribed directly from the paper's stated equations (not independently re-derived). Two checks: (1)
Hermiticity of H at several (m_tilde, x) points and N=2/N=3 (necessary, not sufficient); (2) the trickiest
term to get right by hand, the electric term's 4-body color-exchange piece
(sigma+_{2n-1}sigma-_{2n}sigma+_{2m}sigma-_{2m-1} + h.c.), is expanded into Pauli strings by
`_raise_lower_product_plus_hc` and cross-checked against an independent dense sigma+/sigma- matrix
construction (max abs diff ~1e-16 -- see the module's own test, not committed as a pytest file). Still a
good-faith reproduction of the cited equations rather than an independently re-derived Hamiltonian, and the
overall construction has not been checked against a published spectrum; flagged as a limitation in the
companion notebook.

MVP scope: the paper further reduces the circuit to 3 qubits (meson, N=2) / 4 qubits (baryon, N=4) via a
hardware-motivated qubit-elimination trick specific to their VQE ansatz (decoupling "inactive" qubits via a
separable-state factorization), and computes a hadron mass RATIO from separate meson/baryon/vacuum VQE
runs. We do not reproduce that reduction trick or the mass-ratio calculation here -- both are future work.
Our MVP instead uses the *un-reduced* N=2 Hamiltonian directly (4 qubits, no qubit-elimination trick
needed) as a single genuine SU(2)-LGT ground-state VQE benchmark, exactly analogous to how Tracks A/B/C
compare Q-MAML against classical initialization on a verified Hamiltonian -- the same research question
this whole project asks, just not yet the paper's own headline hadron-mass-ratio result.
